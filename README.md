# kh-real-estate
This is a machine learning project for predicting the real estate prices in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

# Data
The raw data is too big to be uploaded to GitHub, so I sotre it on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d5rYXEZyqvlsx12DfGhWXJhwa-RjGR33/view?usp=sharing). The data used for building the model is a subset of the raw data, saved in `filtered-data.pkl`.
